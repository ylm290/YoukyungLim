Bioinformatician | Data Scientist | Technical Support | Project Management
I am a bioinformatician with 4 years of experience in transcriptomic and single-cell data analysis. Having started my career in Technical Support at a Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) service company, I developed a passion for problem-solving and collaborating across disciplines in a rapidly evolving field. I am excited to contribute to advancing scientific discoveries through data analysis.
